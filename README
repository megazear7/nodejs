The best server to base a server on (as of 10/17/2013) is the one in uploadImageToTmp and SubmitTextAndShowFile.

The order of progression goes as follows:

helloWorld -> simplerServer -> causeBashCommandFromWeb -> submitTextandShowFile -> uploadImageToTmp

Controller View Model was not implemented in this. The next example server should probably be to add in controller view model.

Another example server that shows how to do unit testing could also be helpful.

Another example server that creates / utilizes custom NPM packages would be useful.

And another one that explains object-oriented javascript could also be useful.
